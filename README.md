# Netflix-movie-recommender
The system recommends 10 movies when you input a movie you once enjoyed on Netflix. The dataset is a public dataset that can be found on kaggle. I used python libraries such as pandas, sklearn and nltk. Pandas is used for the preprocessing while nltk is used for the text preprocessing.
